# Opinions on running software projects

Donâ€™t make everybody busy from day one. Use the first stages of a software
project to facilitate pair or ensemble programming sessions that will help to
develop a shared understanding.

Embrace some early duplication. Use the first few weeks to explore the problem
space and try different approaches. Removing duplication is often easier than
dealing with flawed architectures.

Optimize for shorter feedback loops. Trunk-based development, test-driven
development, or continuous deployment are techniques that guide the team toward
this objective.

When developing your initial test suite, optimize for confidence rather than
speed. Nothing is inherently wrong with having more acceptance/integration tests
than unitary ones. Confidence is critical to moving fast (and you can always fix
performance later).

When writing documentation, favor how-to guides (how to execute a background
job, how to log analytics events) and architecture decision records (so
everybody can understand the WHY of certain design decisions).

Tackle the tasks with the most uncertainty first.

Simple !== Easy, but beware, they are often confused. Simple solutions are
harder to design and implement.

Good software design always pays off.

Slice the work wisely. Rather than slicing by technical layers (for example,
creating one task for front-end work and another for back-end work), use slices
that make business sense and provide value (i.e., the minimum viable feature).
Vertical slices enable shorter feedback loops and reduce integration problems.

If using a pull-requests-based workflow, avoid the notion of one feature = one
pull request. Use stacked pull requests to generate smaller reviewable units.

Keep your options open. Use the
