# Opinions on managing software projects

Donâ€™t try to parallelize the work too early. Instead, use pair-programming or
ensemble-programming sessions to create a shared understanding of the
foundational concepts of the project.

Embrace some early duplication. Give some time to understand the problem space
and try different approaches. It is usually easy to remove duplication later.

Set up CI/CD early on. It will help you demonstrate progress; also, these
workflows are easier to install when the project is simple.

Tests. Use high-level, acceptance-like tests to drive your first few features.
That will ensure your architecture is designed with testability in mind. Then,
keep favoring higher-level tests for a few more cycles (for example, try writing
more integration tests than unit tests).
