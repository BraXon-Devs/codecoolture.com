# Using the Builder pattern for creating test data with ease

If you have yet to hear about [software] design patterns, you may think of them as reusable solutions for everyday
problems that work for different contexts. Of course, new design patterns appear now and then, but there is a
[well-documented core of patterns][design-patterns] that are popular and can be seen in many object-oriented code bases.
The [Builder][builder] pattern is one of them.

Although this pattern may come in handy in multiple situations, it is especially helpful when creating test data. Tests
for any medium-large-sized applications often require us to create various objects, put them in a particular state, and
have relationships with other entities. That can be hard to do, especially if the objects are complex and we need to
create many of them. The Builder pattern offers a solution to use a more semantic, domain-specific interface that makes
the process easier.

For example, imagine we are coding a software system to help manage an automobile repair shop. Not surprisingly, we may
find mechanics and cars. Mechanics can be responsible for multiple vehicles, be on holiday, and have different hourly
salaries. The following test verifies that we can add a new car for a mechanic by following specific requirements.

```ts
import { Car, Mechanic } from "@domain";

describe("POST /mechanics/{id}/cars", () => {
  it("does not add a new car if the mechanic is on holiday", async () => {
    const mechanic = new Mechanic({ id: 1, name: "John Doe" });

    const today = new Date();
    const pto = new Pto({ mechanic, startDate: startOfDay(today), endDate: endOfDay(today) });

    mechanic.ptos = [pto];

    await mechanicRepository.save(mechanic);

    const car = new Car({ id: 1, make: "Mazda", model: "Mazda 3", year: 2021 });
    await carRepository.save(car);

    const response = await request(app).post(`/mechanics/${mechanic.id}/cars`).send({ carId: car.id });

    expect(response.status).toBe(400);
  });

  it("does not add a new car if the mechanic is working on five cars already", async () => {
    const mechanic = new Mechanic({ id: 1, name: "John Doe" });

    mechanic.cars = [
      new Car({ id: 1, make: "Mazda", model: "Mazda 2", year: 2021 }),
      new Car({ id: 2, make: "Mazda", model: "Mazda 3", year: 2021 }),
      new Car({ id: 3, make: "Mazda", model: "CX-30", year: 2021 }),
      new Car({ id: 4, make: "Mazda", model: "MX-5", year: 2021 }),
      new Car({ id: 5, make: "Mazda", model: "CX-60", year: 2021 }),
    ];

    await mechanicRepository.save(mechanic);

    const car = new Car({ id: 6, make: "Mazda", model: "CX-9", year: 2021 });
    await carRepository.save(car);

    const response = await request(app).post(`/mechanics/${mechanic.id}/cars`).send({ carId: car.id });

    expect(response.status).toBe(400);
  });
});
```

As you may see in the code block above, creating all these objects by hand is expensive and makes the whole test hard to
read. Let's try instead to use a `MechanicBuilder` that makes the process easier while producing the same result.

```ts
import { MechanicBuilder, CarBuilder } from "@test/builders";

describe("POST /mechanics/{id}/cars", () => {
  it("does not add a new car if the mechanic is on holiday", async () => {
    const mechanic = await new MechanicBuilder().onHoliday().save(mechanicRepository);
    const car = await new CarBuilder().save(carRepository);

    const response = await request(app).post(`/mechanics/${mechanic.id}/cars`).send({ carId: car.id });

    expect(response.status).toBe(400);
  });

  it("does not add a new car if the mechanic is working on five cars already", async () => {
    const mechanic = await new MechanicBuilder().withCars(5).save(mechanicRepository);
    const car = await new CarBuilder().save(carRepository);

    const response = await request(app).post(`/mechanics/${mechanic.id}/cars`).send({ carId: car.id });

    expect(response.status).toBe(400);
  });
});
```

Reading the code above, we can clearly see the scenario we are creating for the test. The builder reduces verbosity and
makes the code more expressive while favoring reusability for other test cases. Of course, we may keep adding methods to
the `MechanicBuilder` as new requirements appear, so we always have an up-to-date, semantic interface to create
`Mechanic` objects (and the same applies for `Car` instances).

## Example of a Builder implementation using TypeScript

Wondering how you can create that fancy builder above in TypeScript? üòè As with many things in software development,
different paths may lead to the same result, but this approach worked very well for me in the past.

I use an interface to define the shape classes need to implement to work as a Builder.

```ts
export interface Builder<T> {
  build(): T;
  save(repository: Repository<T>): Promise<T>;
}
```

Then, I like to create an `abstract` class that implements the interface and provides a basic implementation for the
`build` and `save` methods (here, I use inheritance just for code reusability).

```ts
import { Builder } from "@test/builders";

export abstract class BaseBuilder<T> implements Builder<T> {
  protected abstract entity: T;

  public build(): T {
    return this.entity;
  }

  public save(repository: Repository<T>): Promise<T> {
    return repository.save(this.entity);
  }
}
```

Finally, we can create the `MechanicBuilder` simply by extending the `BaseBuilder` and providing all the additional
methods.

```ts
import { Mechanic } from "@domain";
import { BaseBuilder, CarBuilder, PtoBuilder } from "@test/builders";

export class MechanicBuilder extends BaseBuilder<Mechanic> {
  protected entity: Mechanic;

  constructor() {
    super();

    this.entity = new Mechanic({ id: 1, name: "John Doe" });
  }

  public onHoliday(): this {
    this.entity.ptos = [new PtoBuilder().for(this.entity).on(new Date()).build()];

    return this;
  }

  public withCars(count: number): this {
    this.entity.cars = new Array(count).fill(null).map(() => new CarBuilder().build());

    return this;
  }
}
```

Note how we return `this` in the `onHoliday` and `withCars` methods. That is the secret sauce to making the Builder
provide a [fluent interface][fluent] so that we can use it in the following way:

```ts
const mechanic = await new MechanicBuilder().onHoliday().withCars(5).save(mechanicRepository);
```
