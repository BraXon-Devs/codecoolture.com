# About me

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Sergio, a software engineer from Oviedo, Spain. I've worked in technology for over a decade and had
the luck to work in different product companies at various stages and positions (from junior to CTO!). I'm currently
working at [GitHub](https://github.com) as a Senior Software Engineer.

My main interests are software design, product development (I have not only worked at product companies but also on
multiple side projects), and team leadership. I have experience coaching and mentoring software teams. I'm a strong
advocate of practices such as test-driven development (hey, [I even have a workshop about it][tddworkshop]!), continuous
delivery, and (true) Agile approaches.

In 2016 I co-founded [AsturiasHacking][asturiashacking], the first large software group in Asturias, Spain.

Did I mention I'm an occasional speaker too? I've given talks at national and international conferences, such as
[Codemotion Madrid][codemotion] or [Agile Testing Days Berlin][atd].

If you want to know more about me, please check out my [Twitter account][twitter], [GitHub profile][github], or
[LinkedIn profile][linkedin].
