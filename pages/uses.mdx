These are some tools, platforms, apps, and services I use daily.

## Hardware

- **MacBook Pro 13-inch, 2020 (i5 2GHz Quad-Core, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD)**: not especially happy with the performance of
  this machine. It overheats a lot. I will probably upgrade to a MacBook Pro with the M1 chip sooner rather than later.
- [**reMarkable 2**](https://remarkable.com/): loving this lil' device. I use it for taking notes, sketching, and
  reading both eBooks and PDFs.
- [**Logitech Craft**](https://www.logitech.com/es-es/products/keyboards/craft.html): had to remap some keys, but a
  great keyboard overall.
- [**Logitech MX Master 2s**](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/eol/mx-master-2s-mouse.910-005131.html): loving this line
  of mice.
- [**Dell P2421D Monitor**](https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/dell-24-monitor-p2421d/apd/210-aull): not expensive,
  but sharp and reliable.
